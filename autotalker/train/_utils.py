    EarlyStopping class for early stopping of Autotalker training.

    This early stopping class was inspired by

    Parameters
    ----------
    early_stopping_metric:
        The metric on which the early stopping criterion is calculated.
    metric_improvement_threshold:
        The minimum value which counts as metric_improvement.
    patience:
        Number of epochs which are allowed to have no metric_improvement until 
        the training is stopped.
    reduce_lr_on_plateau:
        If "True", the learning rate gets adjusted by "lr_factor" after a given 
        number of epochs with no
        metric_improvement.
    lr_patience:
        Number of epochs which are allowed to have no metric_improvement until 
        the learning rate is adjusted.
    lr_factor:
        Scaling factor for adjusting the learning rate.
